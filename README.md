# La Chancla

A game made by Angello Hernandez, David Useche, and Alonzo Williams for CMU's SAMS program.

Made in Unity. 

Note: The initial commits and their non-descriptiveness have been preserved, so that due credit is given (note that Alonzo's contributions are all the art assets). 

High Schooler immaturity may be involved; fair warning.

Note 2: This is not the final version of the game that was presented for SAMS; unfortunately, in this version, the title screen, game over screen, and win screen are not implemented and a couple of bugs are still present. The final version is not in my possession.
