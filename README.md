# La Chancla

A game made by Angello Hernandez, David Useche, and Alonzo Williams for CMU's SAMS program.

Our protagonist, Jebediah, is sneaking out. He must avoid his aunties' thrown chanclas and collect his keys, flowers, and phone so that he can get to his girlfriend for the night. 

Made in Unity. 

Note: The initial commits and their non-descriptiveness have been preserved, so that due credit is given (note that Alonzo's contributions are all the art assets). 

High Schooler immaturity may be involved; fair warning.

Note 2: This is not the final version of the game that was presented for SAMS; unfortunately, in this version, the title screen, game over screen, and win screen are not implemented and a couple of bugs are still present. The final version is not in my possession.
